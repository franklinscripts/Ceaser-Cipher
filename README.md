**Hello Dear**
you can contribute to this project and i will merge it if you have a better idea on either design, code structures etc....

## Desc
This is a simple but very algorithmic project for developers, it takes you time and research if you don't really know of the ceaser's cipher.
I also struggled with how the shift keys will look like untill I decided to use an array with its index portraying a very good task in this project.
